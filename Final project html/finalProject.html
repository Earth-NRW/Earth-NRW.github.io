        <h1>My Chest/Back Day Workout Plan</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Greetings! I'm one of those fitness enthusiast, so what I'm going to share here is the workout routine for my Chest/Back day. <br>
            I think it's very time consuming for me to gather all the information require to construct my own workout routine which allows the well-rounded development <br>
            for each muscle groups due to plenty of exercise variation out there. Note that you could check some other variations here from this link:<br>
            <a href="https://breakingmuscle.com/chest-and-back-workout/">Other Exercise Variations for Chest and Back</a></p>
            <p>However, after weeks of research, I came up with this workout routine for Chest/Back day (you could split using other variations). <br>
            I prefer using free-weight, so most of the exercise would involve a pair of dumbbells</p>
            <p>To cover most of the muscles in chest/back, I also include some machine exercises. Here's the lists.</p>

        <p>By doing each for 3 sets at 8-12 reps with 1 minute rest between sets of isolation exercises and 2 minute rest for compound exercises,<br>
        it's possible that you would see some gains after a month. However, it's important to work other muscle groups as well (shoulders, arms, legs, etc.)<br>
        and incoporate with cardio, good diet, and good sleep to gain some decent physiques.</p>
